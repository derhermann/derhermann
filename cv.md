## Long Version

I’m a **Senior Product Engineer** with over **13 years’** hands-on experience delivering fast, reliable solutions and automating workflows. My career spans two¹ companies:

- **Studitemps GmbH (Jul 2012 – Oct 2020):** Joined during its startup phase and helped scale it into one of the industry’s leaders over eight years.  
- **Greator GmbH (Jun 2021 – Present):** Guided the team through challenging times, restoring it to market prominence over the last four years.

I’m a quick learner of new languages, frameworks, and tools—most of my work has been in **PHP, Python, HTML, CSS,** and **JavaScript**. Although self-taught, I’ve had the privilege of working in environments that encouraged learning and growth; I compensate for any gaps in formal theory with broad, practical experience.

In recent years, my focus shifted from  
> “How do we build this well?”  

to  
> “Why are we building it, and how will it serve our users and our business?”

I love solving problems, whether by writing clean, maintainable code or by collaborating across teams to find the best path forward.


## Work Experience

### Full Stack Developer, Studitemps GmbH  
**Jul 2012 – Oct 2020**  
Partnering closely with marketing, I built everything from micro-sites and workflow-automation tools to APIs, internal knowledge bases, and the corporate website, often on tight deadlines.

**Key achievements:**
- Automated job-posting mailouts, reducing manual effort and errors.  
- Cleansed and enriched CRM data via scripts that corrected records or flagged anomalies.  
- Launched an internal knowledge base with an integrated ordering system for flyers, brochures, and marketing materials.  
- Created an NPS-collection tool that captures customer feedback, analyzes responses, and generates action items.  
- Developed an event platform to send invites (via Zendesk), track RSVPs and attendance, and gather NPS feedback.

### Senior Software Engineer, Greator GmbH
**Jun 2021 – Jul 2024**  
After pivoting away from a failed app, the business focused on WordPress-based LMS sites using BuddyBoss and LearnDash. I refactored legacy plugins and built custom features to boost engagement and streamline product management.

**Key achievements:**
- Engineered “Practice Coaching” and “Final Exam” modules, enabling users to upload coaching videos for peer and head-coach review and pass/fail assessments.  
- Built dynamic Zoom integrations where users could add upcoming Q&As to their calendars, join live sessions, or watch recordings, with role-based access control.  
- Integrated HubSpot and our LMS so participant progress triggers marketing workflows or unlocks content based on HubSpot list membership.  
- Designed a QR-code scanner system to manage rental and return of 4,700+ translation devices, improving tracking efficiency and removing the need for expensive and proprietary scanner devices.

### Senior Product Engineer, Greator GmbH
**Jul 2024 – Present**  
Transitioning into a hybrid product-tech role, I work hand-in-hand with product managers, designers, and stakeholders to define and build the LMS our users truly need.

**Key achievements:**
- Analyzed developer effort and system bottlenecks, translated them into metrics for C-level decision-makers, and secured approval to develop a proprietary LMS.  
- Authored a comprehensive Software Requirements Specification (SRS) involving Product Management and Customer Happiness, laying the groundwork for a smooth development process.
- Led a team of four to develop this LMS, ensuring clear roles, efficient collaboration, and developer happiness.
- Employed multiple tools like Example Mapping to communicate requirements and workflows, keeping the team aligned on user stories and acceptance criteria.
